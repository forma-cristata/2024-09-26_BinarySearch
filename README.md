# Binary Search Implementation

A lightweight and efficient binary search implementation for sorted integer arrays.

## Overview

This project provides a streamlined binary search method that works with ascending-ordered integer arrays. The implementation focuses on performance and clean code practices.

## Features

- Custom binary search implementation
- Optimized for sorted integer arrays
- Minimalist approach without external dependencies

## Technical Requirements

The implementation avoids using CompareTo() and Equals() methods, as well as LINQ, to maintain simplicity and performance.
